// Pi Calm - animated working presentation.

//
// Calm replaces Pi's stock working row with a tiny three-row ASCII boat while one
// logical agent run is active. This module owns only the sprite geometry, the
// bounce track, the two animation cadences, the session-scoped freeze/resume
// state, and the temporary TUI widget; ../index.ts owns when the presentation
// is installed and removed, and stays the sole caller of setWorkingVisible().
//
// Cadence: one scheduler drives two logically independent clocks. The water
// drifts every CALM_WORKING_SHIP_TICKS_PER_WATER_SHIFT-th tick and the boat
// moves every CALM_WORKING_SHIP_TICKS_PER_MOVE-th tick, so the water visibly
// ripples between boat steps and the boat itself reads as calm. Both clocks stop
// together when the widget is disposed. Ticks, not wall-clock timestamps, drive every state
// change, so tests can seek time exactly.
//
// Continuity: one extension-owned animation instance survives hide/show within
// the same Pi process and Calm extension lifetime. Disposing the widget freezes
// column, direction, water phase, and tick cadence without advancing them for
// hidden wall time. The next working period resumes from that exact logical
// state. A fresh session or new extension lifetime calls reset() and starts at
// the normal initial position. State is never a module-level or process-global
// singleton.
//
// Verified against Pi 0.82.0, which exposes ExtensionUIContext.setWidget() with
// a component factory, per-widget dispose(), and TUI.requestRender(). Pi renders
// a widget through Component.render(width), so this module recomputes its track
// from that width on every frame instead of caching a terminal size that a
// resize would invalidate. A resize while the boat is hidden is applied on the
// first resumed frame through the same clamp path.
